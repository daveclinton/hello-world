# Hi there!
I just completed my Python Programming Course at ALX Udacity, and decided to try out django documentation. This is my first django project, i find django's features really interesting. 
This Hello world Project in Django included the following steps:
Creating a new directory for my code
Installing Django=4.0 in a new virtual enviroment
Creating a new Django project
Creating a new pages app
Updated settings.py
