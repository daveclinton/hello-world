# Hi there!
I just completed my Python Programming Course at ALX Udacity, and decided to try out django documentation. This is my first django project, i find django's features really interesting. <br>
## This Hello world Project in Django included the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Creating a new directory for my code</li>
  <li>Installing Django=4.0 in a new virtual enviroment</li>
  <li>Creating a new Django project</li>
  <li>Creating a new pages app</li>
  <li>Updated settings.py</li>
</ol>
